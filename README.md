# Basket Checkout v3 (React / Redux)

Create a basic user interface for a (much) simplified shopping basket / checkout. A small number of web services is supplied as a self-contained Node.js based server that can be run locally. The user interface displays data from and interacts with the web service endpoints of the supplied local Node.js server.
